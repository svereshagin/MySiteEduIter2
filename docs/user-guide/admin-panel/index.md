# Admin Panel

The FastAPI boilerplate comes with a pre-configured web-based admin interface powered by [CRUDAdmin](https://github.com/benavlabs/crudadmin) that provides instant database management capabilities. Learn how to access, configure, and customize the admin panel for your development and production needs.

> **Powered by CRUDAdmin**: This admin panel is built with [CRUDAdmin](https://github.com/benavlabs/crudadmin), a modern admin interface generator for FastAPI applications.

## What You'll Learn

- **[Configuration](configuration.md)** - Environment variables and deployment settings
- **[Adding Models](adding-models.md)** - Register your new models with the admin interface
- **[User Management](user-management.md)** - Manage admin users and security

## Admin Panel Overview

Your FastAPI boilerplate includes a fully configured admin interface that's ready to use out of the box. The admin panel automatically provides web-based management for your database models without requiring any additional setup.

**What's Already Configured:**

- Complete admin interface mounted at `/admin`
- User, Tier, and Post models already registered
- Automatic form generation and validation
- Session management with configurable backends
- Security features and access controls

**Accessing the Admin Panel:**

1. Start your application: `uv run fastapi dev`
2. Navigate to: `http://localhost:8000/admin`
3. Login with default credentials (configured via environment variables)

## Pre-Registered Models

The boilerplate comes with three models already set up in the admin interface:

### User Management
```python
# Already registered in your admin
admin.add_view(
    model=User,
    create_schema=UserCreate,
    update_schema=UserUpdate,
    allowed_actions={"view", "create", "update"},
    password_transformer=password_transformer,  # Automatic password hashing
)
```

**Features:**

- Create and manage application users
- Automatic password hashing with bcrypt
- User profile management (name, username, email)
- Tier assignment for subscription management

### Tier Management
```python
# Subscription tiers for your application
admin.add_view(
    model=Tier, 
    create_schema=TierCreate, 
    update_schema=TierUpdate, 
    allowed_actions={"view", "create", "update", "delete"}
)
```

**Features:**

- Manage subscription tiers and pricing
- Configure rate limits per tier
- Full CRUD operations available

### Content Management
```python
# Post/content management
admin.add_view(
    model=Post,
    create_schema=PostCreateAdmin,  # Special admin schema
    update_schema=PostUpdate,
    allowed_actions={"view", "create", "update", "delete"}
)
```

**Features:**

- Manage user-generated content
- Handle media URLs and content validation
- Associate posts with users

## Quick Start

### 1. Set Up Admin Credentials

Configure your admin login in your `.env` file:

```bash
# Admin Panel Access
ADMIN_USERNAME="your-admin-username"
ADMIN_PASSWORD="YourSecurePassword123!"

# Basic Configuration
CRUD_ADMIN_ENABLED=true
CRUD_ADMIN_MOUNT_PATH="/admin"
```

### 2. Start the Application

```bash
# Development
uv run fastapi dev

# The admin panel will be available at:
# http://localhost:8000/admin
```

### 3. Login and Explore

1. **Access**: Navigate to `/admin` in your browser
2. **Login**: Use the credentials from your environment variables
3. **Explore**: Browse the pre-configured models (Users, Tiers, Posts)

## Environment Configuration

The admin panel is configured entirely through environment variables, making it easy to adapt for different deployment environments.

### Basic Settings

```bash
# Enable/disable admin panel
CRUD_ADMIN_ENABLED=true                    # Set to false to disable completely

# Admin interface path
CRUD_ADMIN_MOUNT_PATH="/admin"             # Change the URL path

# Admin user credentials (created automatically)
ADMIN_USERNAME="admin"                     # Your admin username
ADMIN_PASSWORD="SecurePassword123!"       # Your admin password
```

### Session Management

```bash
# Session configuration
CRUD_ADMIN_MAX_SESSIONS=10                 # Max concurrent sessions per user
CRUD_ADMIN_SESSION_TIMEOUT=1440            # Session timeout (24 hours)
SESSION_SECURE_COOKIES=true                # HTTPS-only cookies
```

### Production Security

```bash
# Security settings for production
ENVIRONMENT="production"                   # Enables HTTPS enforcement
CRUD_ADMIN_TRACK_EVENTS=true              # Log admin actions
CRUD_ADMIN_TRACK_SESSIONS=true            # Track session activity
```

### Redis Session Storage

For production deployments with multiple server instances:

```bash
# Enable Redis sessions
CRUD_ADMIN_REDIS_ENABLED=true
CRUD_ADMIN_REDIS_HOST="localhost"
CRUD_ADMIN_REDIS_PORT=6379
CRUD_ADMIN_REDIS_DB=0
CRUD_ADMIN_REDIS_PASSWORD="your-redis-password"
CRUD_ADMIN_REDIS_SSL=false
```

## How It Works

The admin panel integrates seamlessly with your FastAPI application through several key components:

### Automatic Initialization

```python
# In src/app/main.py - already configured
admin = create_admin_interface()

@asynccontextmanager
async def lifespan_with_admin(app: FastAPI):
    async with default_lifespan(app):
        if admin:
            await admin.initialize()  # Sets up admin database
        yield

# Admin is mounted automatically at your configured path
if admin:
    app.mount(settings.CRUD_ADMIN_MOUNT_PATH, admin.app)
```

### Configuration Integration

```python
# In src/app/admin/initialize.py - uses your existing settings
admin = CRUDAdmin(
    session=async_get_db,                      # Your database session
    SECRET_KEY=settings.SECRET_KEY,            # Your app's secret key
    mount_path=settings.CRUD_ADMIN_MOUNT_PATH, # Configurable path
    secure_cookies=settings.SESSION_SECURE_COOKIES,
    enforce_https=settings.ENVIRONMENT == EnvironmentOption.PRODUCTION,
    # ... all configured via environment variables
)
```

### Model Registration

```python
# In src/app/admin/views.py - pre-configured models
def register_admin_views(admin: CRUDAdmin):
    # Password handling for User model
    password_transformer = PasswordTransformer(
        password_field="password",
        hashed_field="hashed_password",
        hash_function=get_password_hash,  # Uses your app's password hashing
    )
    
    # Register your models with appropriate schemas
    admin.add_view(model=User, create_schema=UserCreate, ...)
    admin.add_view(model=Tier, create_schema=TierCreate, ...)
    admin.add_view(model=Post, create_schema=PostCreateAdmin, ...)
```

## Development vs Production

### Development Setup

For local development, minimal configuration is needed:

```bash
# .env for development
CRUD_ADMIN_ENABLED=true
ADMIN_USERNAME="admin"
ADMIN_PASSWORD="admin123"
ENVIRONMENT="local"

# Uses memory sessions (fast, no external dependencies)
CRUD_ADMIN_REDIS_ENABLED=false
```

### Production Setup

For production deployments, enable additional security features:

```bash
# .env for production
CRUD_ADMIN_ENABLED=true
ADMIN_USERNAME="production-admin"
ADMIN_PASSWORD="VerySecureProductionPassword123!"
ENVIRONMENT="production"

# Redis sessions for scalability
CRUD_ADMIN_REDIS_ENABLED=true
CRUD_ADMIN_REDIS_HOST="your-redis-host"
CRUD_ADMIN_REDIS_PASSWORD="secure-redis-password"
CRUD_ADMIN_REDIS_SSL=true

# Enhanced security
SESSION_SECURE_COOKIES=true
CRUD_ADMIN_TRACK_EVENTS=true
CRUD_ADMIN_TRACK_SESSIONS=true
```

## Getting Started Guide
